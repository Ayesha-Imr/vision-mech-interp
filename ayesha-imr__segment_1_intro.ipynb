    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to understand how a human brain recognizes faces. You wouldn't just look at the final \"yes, that's a face\" decision. You'd want to understand:\n",
    "- How the eyes detect edges and lines\n",
    "- How the brain combines those edges into shapes\n",
    "- How those shapes become \"nose,\" \"eyes,\" \"mouth\"\n",
    "- How all of that becomes \"face\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**CNNs work the same way.** Before we can \"interpret\" what a CNN is doing, we need to understand its basic mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mental Model We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Images aren't images to a CNN** — they're arrays of numbers (tensors)\n",
    "2. **Convolutions are pattern matchers** — each filter looks for one specific pattern\n",
    "3. **Depth creates abstraction** — stacking simple operations creates complex understanding\n",
    "4. **Space is preserved** — even deep in the network, there's spatial structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this foundation, interpretability techniques will feel like magic. With it, they'll make perfect sense."

    "Filter for detecting vertical edges:\n",
    "[-1,  0,  1]\n",

    "## The Big Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**If deep layers have such low resolution (14×14), how do they still correspond to locations in the original image?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Answer: Receptive Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron in a deep layer doesn't \"see\" one pixel. It sees a **receptive field** — a region of the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Layer 1 neuron:  sees 3×3 pixels\n",
    "Layer 5 neuron:  sees ~40×40 pixels (accumulated through layers)\n",
    "Layer 15 neuron: sees ~200×200 pixels (almost the whole image!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But even though receptive fields grow, **spatial correspondence is maintained**:\n",
    "- Top-left neuron in layer 15 → corresponds to top-left region of image\n",
    "- Bottom-right neuron in layer 15 → corresponds to bottom-right region\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this, we'll:\n",
    "1. Black out a region of the image (the cat's face)\n",
    "2. Compare activations: original vs perturbed\n",
    "3. See where the differences appear\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** Changes should appear in corresponding spatial locations across all layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why techniques like **Grad-CAM** and **saliency maps** work!\n",
    "- They rely on the fact that deep layers still have spatial structure\n",
    "- We can trace activations back to specific image regions"

    "### 1. Images → Tensors → Activations\n",
    "- **CNNs don't \"see\" images** — they see arrays of numbers\n",
    "- **First layer transforms 3 channels → 64 channels** — 64 different pattern responses\n",
    "- **Feature maps ≠ semantic understanding** — they're local pattern detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Convolutions = Pattern Matchers\n",
    "- **Each filter is a 3×3 pattern** (learned from data)\n",
    "- **Filter slides across the image** (weight sharing = efficiency)\n",
    "- **High activation = pattern found** in that location\n",
    "- **Convolution is local, not global** — each position sees only 3×3 neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Depth Creates Abstraction\n",
    "- **Early layers:** Edges, colors (3×3 receptive field)\n",
    "- **Middle layers:** Textures, patterns (40×40 receptive field)\n",
    "- **Deep layers:** Object parts, concepts (200×200 receptive field)\n",
    "- **Abstraction emerges from composition**, not from any single layer being \"smart\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Spatial Structure Persists\n",
    "- **Receptive fields grow** but **spatial correspondence remains**\n",
    "- **Top-left neuron → top-left region** of image, even in deep layers\n",
    "- **This enables spatial interpretability** (Grad-CAM, saliency, etc.)\n",
