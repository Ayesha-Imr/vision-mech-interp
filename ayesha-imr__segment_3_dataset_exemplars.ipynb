        "But synthetic images don't tell us what **real-world inputs** actually trigger those neurons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dataset exemplars** flip the approach:\n",
        "- Instead of *generating* images, we *search* through a large dataset of real images\n",
        "- For each neuron, we find the images that produce the highest activation\n",
